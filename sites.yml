# The description key supports full markdown syntax.

# New tags should strike a generality balance so they convey
# useful information but are still applicable to more than just 1 site.

# date_created is usually the date of first commit on a project which can be found
# by opening the 'Insights > Network' tab on a repo (e.g.
# https://github.com/janosh/awesome-sveltekit/network) and clicking
# cmd/ctrl + left arrow to jump to the very start of the commit history.
# site_src is the link to a subfolder if e.g. the site is part of a monorepo.

# If you introduce a new field, please mention in the PR and add it to site/src/types.ts.
