# For admissible fields see site/src/types.ts. If you introduce a new field,
# please mention in your PR.

# New tags should strike a balance between generality and specificity so they convey
# useful information but are still applicable to at least a few other sites.

# The field 'dateCreated' is usually the date of first commit on a project.
