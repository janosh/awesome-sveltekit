<!-- Entry requirements for new sites:

- open source: While a site with private code can give design and feature ideas, there's little educational value if you can't inspect how it was made.
- novel: Not just another blog or todo app. Ideally, some application or technology not already covered in this collection.
- popular: At least 50 stars on GitHub or reasonable expectation to reach that number soon.

New sites should be added to sites.yml, not the auto-generated readme.

If you're unsure if a site belongs here, [open a discussion](https://github.com/janosh/awesome-sveltekit/discussions) first.

If your new site includes a tool/language/package in its `uses: [...]` field that's
not already used by another site, make sure you add a link to that tool in tools.yml. -->
