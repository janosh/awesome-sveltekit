<!-- All site suggestions must be open-source. This collection is meant as a learning resource for Svelte devs. While a site with private code can give inspiration, there's little educational value if you can't inspect how it was made.

New sites should be added to sites.yml, not the auto-generated readme.

If you're unsure if a site belongs here, [open an issue](https://github.com/janosh/awesome-sveltekit/issues/new) to discuss.
This repo is meant to be a community effort.

If your new site includes a tool/language/package in its `uses: [...]` field that's
not already used by another site, make sure you add a link to that tool in tools.yml. -->
